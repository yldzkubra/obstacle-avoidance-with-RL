# Lidar-Based Reinforcement Learning for Obstacle Avoidance Robot Simulation

This project contains a robot simulation that avoids obstacles using lidar sensors. The robot has a differential drive feature and is implemented 
with PID and pure pursuit controllers. However, the improvements to these controllers are ongoing.



**Features:**

- Detects environmental obstacles using lidar sensors.
- Reinforcement learning algorithm learns and improves the robot's obstacle avoidance strategy.
- The differential drive feature enables the robot to maneuver smoothly and accurately.
- PID and pure pursuit controllers stabilize the robot's motion and guide it to the target.

**Start the simulation:**

 python main.py
